            <p id="SuperWeaponInstructions">The Laser Beam is your ship's powerful Super Weapon, capable of dealing heavy damage to both standard 
                aliens and bosses. It charges gradually over time, indicated by a blue energy bar that fills up as power builds. You can fire the 
                Laser Beam at any charge level by pressing F, but the energy bar will decrease depending on how much power you use. If the bar is 
                completely empty, it turns red as it slowly begins recharging, and the weapon cannot be activated. Once triggered, the Laser Beam 
                enters a brief warm-up phase lasting a few seconds. During this time, the Laser Beam itself is disabled, but your main blasters 
                remain fully operational. You must wait for the cooldown to finish until you can reuse the Laser Beam again. The energy bar returns 
                to blue once the Laser Beam is ready for use again</p>

                to eliminate. This enemey will show up not as much in the beginging rounds but will show up more in middle rounds. It will then will 
                start to decrease in the later rounds</p>

            This enemy will rarely show up in the beginging rounds but as the game progressilys it will show up more and then on round 101+ it will be 
            the only enemy showing up</p>
